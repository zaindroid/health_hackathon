# Medical Reference Guide - Lab Values & Vital Signs

## Complete Blood Count (CBC)

### Hemoglobin
- **Normal Range (Male):** 13.5-17.5 g/dL
- **Normal Range (Female):** 12.0-16.0 g/dL
- **Low (<12 g/dL):** Suggests anemia - may indicate iron deficiency, chronic disease, or blood loss
- **High (>18 g/dL):** Suggests polycythemia - may indicate dehydration, lung disease, or bone marrow disorder
- **Patient-friendly explanation:** Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Low levels mean you might feel tired, weak, or short of breath.

### White Blood Cell Count (WBC)
- **Normal Range:** 4,000-11,000 cells/μL
- **Low (<4,000):** Leukopenia - weakened immune system, higher infection risk
- **High (>11,000):** Leukocytosis - often indicates infection or inflammation
- **Very High (>20,000):** May suggest serious infection or leukemia - requires immediate evaluation
- **Patient-friendly explanation:** White blood cells are your body's defense against infection. Low count means you're more vulnerable to getting sick.

### Platelet Count
- **Normal Range:** 150,000-400,000/μL
- **Low (<150,000):** Thrombocytopenia - increased bleeding risk
- **High (>400,000):** Thrombocytosis - increased clotting risk
- **Patient-friendly explanation:** Platelets help your blood clot to stop bleeding. Too few means you bruise easily or bleed longer.

## Metabolic Panel

### Blood Glucose (Fasting)
- **Normal:** 70-100 mg/dL
- **Prediabetes:** 100-125 mg/dL
- **Diabetes:** ≥126 mg/dL (on two separate tests)
- **Low (<70):** Hypoglycemia - may cause dizziness, confusion, shakiness
- **Patient-friendly explanation:** This measures sugar in your blood. High levels over time can damage blood vessels and nerves.

### Cholesterol Panel
- **Total Cholesterol:** <200 mg/dL (desirable)
- **LDL (Bad Cholesterol):** <100 mg/dL (optimal), <70 mg/dL (if high cardiovascular risk)
- **HDL (Good Cholesterol):** >60 mg/dL (protective), <40 mg/dL (increased risk)
- **Triglycerides:** <150 mg/dL (normal)
- **Patient-friendly explanation:** LDL is "bad" cholesterol that can clog arteries. HDL is "good" cholesterol that helps remove the bad kind.

### Creatinine & Kidney Function
- **Creatinine (Normal):** 0.6-1.2 mg/dL
- **High Creatinine:** May indicate kidney disease
- **eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate):**
  - >90: Normal kidney function
  - 60-89: Mild kidney disease
  - 30-59: Moderate kidney disease
  - <30: Severe kidney disease
- **Patient-friendly explanation:** Creatinine is a waste product filtered by kidneys. High levels mean kidneys aren't working as well as they should.

### Liver Function Tests
- **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase):** 7-56 U/L
- **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase):** 10-40 U/L
- **Elevated levels:** May indicate liver inflammation or damage
- **Patient-friendly explanation:** These enzymes leak into blood when liver cells are damaged. High levels suggest the liver needs medical attention.

## Vital Signs

### Heart Rate
- **Resting (Adults):** 60-100 BPM
- **Bradycardia:** <60 BPM - common in athletes, but may indicate heart block
- **Tachycardia:** >100 BPM - may indicate stress, anxiety, dehydration, infection, or heart problems
- **Concerning:** <50 BPM or >120 BPM at rest - see doctor
- **Urgent:** <40 BPM or >150 BPM at rest - seek medical attention

### Blood Pressure
- **Normal:** <120/80 mmHg
- **Elevated:** 120-129/<80 mmHg
- **Hypertension Stage 1:** 130-139/80-89 mmHg
- **Hypertension Stage 2:** ≥140/90 mmHg
- **Hypertensive Crisis:** >180/120 mmHg - EMERGENCY

### Respiratory Rate
- **Normal (Adults):** 12-20 breaths/min
- **High (>20):** May indicate infection, anxiety, lung disease
- **Low (<12):** May indicate respiratory depression

### Body Temperature
- **Normal:** 97°F-99°F (36.1°C-37.2°C)
- **Low-grade fever:** 99°F-100.4°F
- **Fever:** >100.4°F (38°C)
- **High fever:** >103°F (39.4°C) - see doctor
- **Dangerous:** >105°F (40.5°C) - seek immediate care

### Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)
- **Normal:** 95-100%
- **Mild hypoxemia:** 90-94% - monitor closely
- **Moderate hypoxemia:** 85-89% - see doctor
- **Severe hypoxemia:** <85% - seek immediate medical attention

## Pupil Assessment

### Normal Pupil Size
- **In bright light:** 2-4 mm diameter
- **In darkness:** 4-8 mm diameter
- **Anisocoria (unequal pupils):** Difference <1mm usually normal

### Abnormal Pupil Findings
- **Dilated pupils (>6mm in light):** May indicate drug use, neurological issue, or head injury
- **Constricted pupils (<2mm):** May indicate drug use or neurological problem
- **Unequal pupils (>1mm difference):** May indicate:
  - Head injury or stroke
  - Brain aneurysm
  - Tumor
  - Infection
  - **Action:** If sudden onset with headache, vision changes, or other symptoms - SEEK EMERGENCY CARE

## Red Flags Requiring Immediate Medical Attention

### Chest Pain
- Crushing, squeezing, or pressure sensation
- Radiating to arm, jaw, neck, or back
- Associated with shortness of breath, sweating, nausea
- **Action:** CALL 911 - possible heart attack

### Severe Headache
- Sudden, severe "thunderclap" headache
- Worst headache of life
- With fever, stiff neck, confusion
- After head injury
- **Action:** SEEK EMERGENCY CARE - possible stroke, aneurysm, or meningitis

### Difficulty Breathing
- Severe shortness of breath at rest
- Inability to speak full sentences
- Blue lips or fingernails
- **Action:** CALL 911 - possible heart or lung emergency

### Neurological Symptoms
- Sudden weakness or numbness (face, arm, leg)
- Sudden confusion or trouble speaking
- Sudden vision changes
- Sudden severe dizziness
- **Action:** CALL 911 - possible stroke

## When to See a Doctor (Non-Emergency)

- Persistent fever >3 days
- Unexplained weight loss
- New or worsening symptoms
- Abnormal lab values (even if feeling fine)
- Chronic fatigue or weakness
- Changes in bowel or bladder habits
- Persistent pain

## Understanding Lab Report Language

- **WNL (Within Normal Limits):** Results are normal
- **Borderline:** Close to abnormal, worth monitoring
- **Critical Values:** Dangerously abnormal, requires immediate attention
- **Reference Range:** Normal values for your age, sex, and the specific lab
- **Trending:** Looking at changes over time is often more important than a single value

## Important Notes

1. **Context Matters:** Lab values must be interpreted in context of symptoms, medical history, and physical exam.
2. **Reference Ranges Vary:** Different labs may have slightly different normal ranges.
3. **Individual Variation:** What's normal for you might be slightly different from the average.
4. **Don't Panic:** One abnormal value doesn't always mean serious disease. Often needs repeat testing or further evaluation.
5. **Timing Matters:** Some tests require fasting or specific timing to be accurate.

This guide is for educational purposes. Always consult with a healthcare provider to interpret your specific lab results.
